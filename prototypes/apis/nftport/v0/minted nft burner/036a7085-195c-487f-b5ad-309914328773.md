Burns an NFT which has been previously minted with Customizable minting. Burning an NFT means destroying it by sending it to a null (un-spendable) address. Transactions leading up to the burn will remain on the blockchain.<br>
<br>
Note: Burning is possible only if the token is owned by the contract owner and the token has not been transferred/sold yet.<br>
