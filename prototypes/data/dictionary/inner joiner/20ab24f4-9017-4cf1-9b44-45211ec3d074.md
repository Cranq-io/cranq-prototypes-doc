Joins dictionary 'b' to dictionary `a`, by matching the values of `a` to the keys of `b`.<br>
<br>
Items from `b` with no matching value in `a` are excluded from the result.<br>
<br>
Items from `a` with no matching key in `b` are excluded from the result.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. {"first":"first_id", "third":"third_id", "fifth":"fifth_id"}@0 received via `a`<br>
2. {"first_id":1, "second_id":2, "third_id":3}@0 received via `b`<br>
3. `joined` sends {"first": 1,"third": 3}@0<br>
