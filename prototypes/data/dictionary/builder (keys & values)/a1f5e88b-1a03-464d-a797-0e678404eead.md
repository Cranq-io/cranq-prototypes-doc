---

Builds a dictionary based on matching arrays of keys and values. Items are constructed from the same indices of the input arrays.<br>
<br>
If the array received by `keys` contains duplicates,  only the last precedent is taken into effect - the other corresponding values are discarded.<br>
<br>
If the item counts of the input arrays differ, the out-of-bounds items are ignored.<br>
<br>
Example A:<br>
1. [ "first", "third", "fifth" ]@0 received via `keys`<br>
2. [ 1, 3, 5 ]@0 received via `values`<br>
3. `dict` sends { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 }@0<br>
<br>
Example B:<br>
1. [ "first", "third", "fifth" ]@0 received via `keys`<br>
2. [ 1, 3 ]@0 received via `values`<br>
3. `dict` sends { "first": 1, "third": 3 }@0<br>
<br>
Example C:<br>
1. [ "first", "first", "fifth" ]@0 received via `keys`<br>
2. [ 1, 3, 5 ]@0 received via `values`<br>
3. `dict` sends { "first": 3,  "fifth": 5 }@0<br>

__Keywords__: dictionary, dict, build, new, create, zip

### Input ports

* __keys__: ` string[] `

    Receives the keys to construct the dictionary from.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    ["first","third","fifth"]<br>


* __values__: ` any[] `

    Receives the values to construct the dictionary from.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    [1, 3, 5]<br>

### Output ports

* __dict__: ` {string: any[][number]} `

    Sends the resulting dictionary.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 }<br>
