---

Iterates over nodes in a tree (deeply nested object) structure, as specified by the query.<br>
The `query` acts as a filter for the iteration. It could hold strings for object keys, numbers for array indices, or objects describing either catch-all or a set of keys to include.<br>
<br>
An example `query`: ["foo", 1, {"type":"wildcard"}, {"type":"options", "options": ["bar", "baz"]}]<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. {"foo": [0, {"a": { "bar": 1 }, "b": { "baz": 1 }}]}@0 is received via `tree`<br>
2.  ["foo", 1, {"type":"wildcard"}, {"type":"options", "options": ["bar", "baz"]}]@0 is received via `query`<br>
3. ["foo", 1, "a", "bar"]@0:0 is sent via `path`<br>
4. 1@0:0 is sent via `node`<br>
5. the original `tree` is sent via `tree`<br>
6. ["foo", 1, "a", "baz"]@0:1 is sent via `path`<br>
7. 1@0:1 is sent via `node`<br>
8. the original `tree` is sent via `tree`<br>
9. null@0 is sent via `done`<br>

__Keywords__: tree, iterator, foreach

### Input ports

* __tree__: ` (any[] or {string: any}) `

    The tree data structure to iterate over on.<br>


* __query__: 
    ```
    (string or number or {"type" :"wildcard"} or {"type" :"options", "options" :(string[] or number[])})[]
    ```

    Pattern for paths. Array of strings, numbers or expressions.<br>
    Strings look for exact matches, numbers for array indices and expressions describe matching mechanisms.<br>
    <br>
    {"type": "wildcard"}<br>
    Matches any key in the current node.<br>
    <br>
    {"type": "options", "options":[]}<br>
    Matches the listed keys.<br>

### Output ports

* __path__: ` (string or number)[] `

    Sends the current path in the iteration<br>


* __node__: ` any `

    Sends the current node in the iteration<br>


* __tree__: ` (any[] or {string: any}) `

    Sends the entire tree<br>


* __done__: ` null `

    Sends null when the iteration is done<br>
