---

Stores data and sends it via `data` when read. When the store is empty, read attempts will be buffered until the store gets initialized via `data`.<br>
<br>
Example: late initialization<br>
1. null@1 received via `read`<br>
2. null@2 received via `read`<br>
3. "hello"@3 received via `data`<br>
4. "hello"@1 sent via `data` (output)<br>
5. "hello"@2 sent via `data` (output)<br>
