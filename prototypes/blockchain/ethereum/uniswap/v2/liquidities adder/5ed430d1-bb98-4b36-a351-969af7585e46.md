### Input ports

* __pairs__: 
    ```
    [
      {"address": string, "desiredAmount": number, optional "minimalAmount": number},
      {
        "address": (string or "ETH"),
        "desiredAmount": number,
        optional "minimalAmount": number
      }
    ][]
    ```

    Receives a list of parameters for the liquidity pools.<br>
    <br>
    Each list item consists of a pair of tokens to be added to the liquidity pool:<br>
     - tokenA<br>
     - tokenB or ETH<br>
    <br>
    For tokenA the paramters are:<br>
    - address: the address of the token<br>
    - desiredAmount: the (maximal) amount we want to add to the liquidity pool in tokenA<br>
    - minimalAmount: the minimal amount we want to add to the liquidity pool in tokenA, if the current exchange ratio implies an amount smaller than that, the operation should fail<br>
    <br>
    For tokenB or ETH the parameters are:<br>
    - address: the address of the token or "ETH"<br>
    - desiredAmount: the (maximal) amount we want to add to the liquidity pool in tokenB/ETH<br>
    - minimalAmount: the minimal amount we want to add to the liquidity pool in tokenB/ETH, if the current exchange ratio implies an amount smaller than that, the operation should fail<br>


* __to address__: ` string `

    Receives the address that will get the minted liquidity token.<br>


* __deadline__: ` number `

    Receives the unix timestamp of the deadline until the operation should be completed or will be reverted.<br>


* __router contract__: ` {"address": string, "abi": {string: any}[]} `

* __credentials__: ` {"providerUrl": string, "privateKey": string} `
