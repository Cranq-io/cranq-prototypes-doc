Divides the received `dividend` by the received `divisor` and sends the quotient via `quotient`. Bounces synced operands on division by zero.<br>
<br>
Example (valid division):<br>
<br>
1. 1@0 is received via `dividend`<br>
2. 2@0 is received via `divisor`<br>
3. 0.5@0 is sent via `quotient`<br>
<br>
Example (divide by zero):<br>
<br>
1. 13@0 is received via `dividend`<br>
2. 0@0 is received via `divisor`<br>
3. {"dividend":13, "divisor":0}@0 is sent via `bounced`<br>
