# Forked aggregator (async)

_[flow/Forked aggregator (async)]_

---

Aggregates data received via `data` into two output arrays, depending on whether a corresponding arbitrary input is received via `true` or `false`.<br>
<br>
Releases both output arrays on receiving a signal on `release`.<br>
<br>
The input `release` is independent from `data`, `true`, and `false`.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. "foo"@0 is received via `data`<br>
2. "bar"@1 is received via `data`<br>
3. "baz"@2 is received via `data`<br>
4. null@0 is received via `false`<br>
5. null@1 is received via `true`<br>
6. null@2 is received via `false`<br>
7. null@3 is received via `release`<br>
8. ["foo", "baz"]@3 is sent via `falses`, and ["bar"]@3 is sent via `trues`<br>

### Input ports

* __release__: ` any `

    Receives signal to release aggregated inputs. Independent of `data`.<br>


* __data__: ` any `

    Receives the data to be forwarded to either output.<br>


* __true__: ` any `

    Receives signal that corresponding `data` should be aggregated into `trues`.<br>


* __false__: ` any `

    Receives signal that corresponding `data` should be aggregated into `falses`.<br>

### Output ports

* __trues__: ` any[] `

    Sends the aggregated data, that was accompanied by signals via `true`.<br>


* __falses__: ` any[] `

    Sends the aggregated data, that was accompanied by signals via `false`.<br>
