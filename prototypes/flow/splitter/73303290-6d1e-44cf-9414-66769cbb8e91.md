# Splitter

_[flow/Splitter]_

---

Splits data received via `unsplit` by fields / indexes.<br>
<br>
Do not use splitters to access optional record fields. Opt for a `data/dictionary/Item getter` in those cases instead.<br>
<br>
Example A (record input):<br>
1.`fields` is set to ["a", "b"]<br>
2. Output ports `a` and `b` get created.<br>
3. {"a": "foo", "b": "bar"}@0 received by `unsplit`<br>
4. "foo"@0 is sent via `a`<br>
5. "bar"@0 is sent via `b`<br>
<br>
Example B (tuple input):<br>
1.`fields` is set to [0, 1]<br>
2. Output ports `0` and `1` get created.<br>
3. ["foo", "bar"]@0 received by `unsplit`<br>
4. "foo"@0 is sent via `0`<br>
5. "bar"@0 is sent via `1`<br>

### Input ports

* __fields__: ` (string[] or number[]) `

    Sets a list of output port names matching property names in the data received via `unsplit`.<br>
    <br>
    Must be parameter.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    ["a", "b"]<br>


* __unsplit__: ` ({string: any} or any[]) `

    Receives records or tuples to be split into individual items.<br>
    <br>
    Examples:<br>
    * {"a": 5, "b": 2}<br>
    * [5, 2]<br>

### Output ports

* __split__: 
    ```
    (({string: any} or any[])[string] or ({string: any} or any[])[number])
    ```

    Sends input data split into individual fields.<br>
