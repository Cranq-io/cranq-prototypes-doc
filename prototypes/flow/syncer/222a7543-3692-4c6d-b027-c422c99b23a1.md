# Syncer

_[flow/Syncer]_

---

Bundles input signals that have the same tag. All inputs must receive exactly one signal for a given tag (or be a parameter) for the bundle (record or tuple, depending on the type of `fields`) to be sent.<br>
<br>
Example A (record):<br>
1. `fields` is set to ["a", "b"]<br>
2. Inputs ports `a` and `b` get created<br>
3. `a` receives "Foo"@0<br>
4. `b` receives "Bar"@0<br>
5. `synced` sends {"a": "Foo", "b": "Bar"}@0<br>
<br>
Example B (tuple):<br>
1. `fields` is set to [0, 1]<br>
2. Inputs ports `0` and `1` get created<br>
3. `0` receives "Foo"@0<br>
4. `1` receives "Bar"@0<br>
5. `synced` sends ["Foo", "Bar"]@0<br>

__Keywords__: merge, build record, build tuple

### Input ports

* __fields__: ` (string[] or number[]) `

    Sets a list of inupt port names matching property names in the data sent via `synced`.<br>
    <br>
    Must be parameter.<br>
    <br>
    Example values:<br>
    * ["a", "b"] will result in record output<br>
    * [0, 1] will result in a tuple output<br>


* __unsynced__: ` any `

    Receives individual item for syncing.<br>

### Output ports

* __synced__: ` ({string: any} or any)[] `

    Sends synchronized inputs as a record or tuple indexed by the names of the ports they were received through.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    {"a": "Foo", "b": "Bar"}<br>
