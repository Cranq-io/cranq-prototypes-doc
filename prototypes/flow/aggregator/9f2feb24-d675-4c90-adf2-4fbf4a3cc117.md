# Aggregator

_[flow/Aggregator]_

---

Aggregates inputs into an array until released.<br>
<br>
A `release` signal must accompany each `data` signal, bearing the same tag.<br>
<br>
The output reflects the order as received through `data`. Matching `release` signals may come in any order as long as each pairs up with a `data` signal.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. true@1 is received via `release`<br>
2. false@0 is received via `release`<br>
3. "a"@0 is received via `data`<br>
4. "b"@1 is received via `data`<br>
5. ["a", "b"]@1 is sent via `aggregated`<br>
