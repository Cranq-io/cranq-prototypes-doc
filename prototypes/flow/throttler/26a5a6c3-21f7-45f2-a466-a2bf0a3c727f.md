---

Throttles the received signal, forwarding only `count` number of signals in `delay` milliseconds.<br>
<br>
Reports internal buffer size via `buffer size`.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. `delay` set to 3000, `count` set to 1 <br>
1. A@1 received via `data`<br>
2. B@2 received via `data` a second later<br>
3. B@2 sent immediately via `data`<br>
4. C@3 received via `data`<br>
5. 1@3 sent via `buffer size`<br>
6. C@3 sent via `data` a second later<br>
6. 0@3 sent via `buffer size`<br>
<br>

__Keywords__: throttle, rate limit, 

### Input ports

* __data__: ` any `

    Receives data to be throttled / rate limited.<br>


* __delay__: ` number `

    Receives the length of the time window in milliseconds, in which to limit the number of signals.<br>
    <br>
    Can be set as parameter.<br>


* __count__: ` number `

    Receives the maximum number of signals to be forwarded in the specified time window.<br>
    <br>
    Can be set as parameter.<br>

### Output ports

* __data__: ` any `

    Forwards the signals received via `data`, throttled.<br>


* __buffer size__: ` number `

    Sends the current size of the throttler's internal buffer.<br>
    <br>
    Only sent when the size changes.<br>
    <br>
    Used for raising errors related to exceeding allowed buffer size.<br>
