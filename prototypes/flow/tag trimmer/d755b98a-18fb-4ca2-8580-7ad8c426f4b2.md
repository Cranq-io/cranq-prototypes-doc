# Tag trimmer

_[flow/Tag trimmer]_

---

Trims the last iterable (colon-separated) section of the tag on the signal received via `data`.<br>
<br>
Bounces when tag is not iterable.<br>
<br>
Opposite of `flow/Tag nester`.<br>
<br>
Used for lining up signals with iterations. (See eg. `data/array/Iterator`.)<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. "A"@"x:9" received via `data`<br>
2. "A"@"x" is sent via `data` (output)<br>

__Keywords__: simulate iteration, fake iteration, synchronization, syncing
