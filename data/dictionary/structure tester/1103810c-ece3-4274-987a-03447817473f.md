# Structure tester

_[data/dictionary/Structure tester]_

---

Tests whether a dictionary  has the same structure as another one. Values are ignored.<br>
<br>
If `strict` is set, extra properties are not tolerated, the provided dictionaries must have the same keys.<br>
<br>
Example A:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. { "first": 0, "fifth": 0 }@0 received via `structure`<br>
3. `strict` is set to false<br>
4. `matches` sends true@0<br>
<br>
Example B:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. { "first": 0, "seventh": 0 }@0 received via `structure`<br>
3. `strict` is set to false<br>
4. `matches` sends false@0<br>
<br>
Example C:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. { "first": 0, "fifth": 0 }@0 received via `structure`<br>
3. `strict` is set to true<br>
4. `matches` sends false@0<br>

    { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 }<br>


* __structure__: ` {string: any} `


    Receives the dictionary with the reference structure, to which the comparison will be made.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    { "first": 0, "fifth": 0 }<br>


* __strict__: ` boolean `


    Receives whether extra keys in `dict` are allowed.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    true<br>

### Output ports
