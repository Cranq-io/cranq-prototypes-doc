Tests whether the value of  a certain `key` in a dictionary equals to the `value` provided.<br>
<br>
If the `key` provided does not exist, the result will be false.<br>

Example A:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. "third"@0 received via `key`<br>
3. 3@0 received via `value`<br>
4. `same` sends true@0<br>

Example B:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. "seventh"@0 received via `key`<br>
3. 7@0 received via `value`<br>
4. `same` sends false@0<br>
