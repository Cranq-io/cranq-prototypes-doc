# Has keys tester

_[data/dictionary/Has keys tester]_

---

Tests whether the key set of the dictionary contains the expected keys.<br>
<br>
If `strict` is set, extra properties are not tolerated, the dictionary provided must have exactly the expected keys.<br>
<br>
Example A:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. ["first", "fifth"]@0 received via `expected keys`<br>
3. `strict` is set to false<br>
4. `has` sends true@0<br>
<br>
Example B:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. ["second", "seventh"]@0 received via `expected keys`<br>
3. `strict` is set to false<br>
4. `has` sends false@0<br>
<br>
Example C:<br>
1. { "first": 1, "third": 3, "fifth": 5 } @0 received via `dict`<br>
2. ["first", "fifth"]@0 received via `expected keys`<br>
3. `strict` is set to true<br>
4. `has` sends false@0<br>
