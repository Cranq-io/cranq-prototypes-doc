# Forwarder (double)

_[flow/Forwarder (double)]_

---

Forwards both received signals in the order of the names of the ports.<br>
<br>
Used for two purposes:<br>
* Ensuring that any of a node's inputs may receive signals or be set as parameter.<br>
* Ensuring the order in which signals are sent.<br>
<br>
Example a) param vs. signal:<br>
1. `2`(input) set to "B"<br>
2. "A"@0 received via `1` (input)<br>
3. "A"@0 sent via `1` (output)<br>
4. "B"@0 sent via `2` (output)<br>
<br>
Example b) signal order:<br>
1. "B"@0 received via `2` (input)<br>
2. "A"@0 received via `1` (input)<br>
3. "A"@0 sent via `1` (output)<br>
4. "B"@0 sent via `2` (output)<br>

__Keywords__: order, signal order, parameter to signal

### Input ports

* __1__: ` any `


    Receives signal or takes parameter to be sent out first.<br>


* __2__: ` any `


    Receives signal or takes parameter to be sent out second.<br>

### Output ports

* __1__: ` any `


    Forwards signal received via `1` (input).<br>


* __2__: ` any `


    Forwards signal received via `2` (input). Does not send before `1` (output).<br>
