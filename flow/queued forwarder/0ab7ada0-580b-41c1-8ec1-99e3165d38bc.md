# Queued forwarder

_[flow/Queued forwarder]_

---

Forwards data received via `data` in the order defined by the tags of the signals received via `reference`.<br>
<br>
Queues `reference` inputs until the first N signals have all received matching inputs via `data` then releases them one-by-one via `data` (output).<br>
<br>
Used to signal sequence after asynchronous transformations.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. "A"@0 received via `reference`<br>
2. "B"@1 received via `reference`<br>
3. "b"@1 received via <br>
