# Tag nester

_[flow/Tag nester]_

---

Creates a new level of iteration on the received tag, by appending ":0" to it.<br>
<br>
Opposite of `flow/Tag trimmer`.<br>
<br>
Used for lining up signals with iterations. (See eg. `data/array/Iterator`.)<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. "A"@0 received via `data`<br>
2. "A"@"0:0" is sent via `data` (output)<br>
<br>
See also:<br>
* `flow/Tag incrementer`<br>
* `flow/Tag trimer`<br>

### Output ports
