# Aggregator (async)

_[flow/Aggregator (async)]_

---

Aggregates inputs into an array until released.<br>
<br>
The `release` signal is received and processed independently from those received via `data`. (As opposed to `flow/Aggregator`.)<br>
<br>
The output reflects the order as received through `data`. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
1. "a"@0 is received via `data`<br>
2. "b"@1 is received via `data`<br>
3. null@2 is received via `release`<br>
5. ["a", "b"]@2 is sent via `aggregated`<br>
