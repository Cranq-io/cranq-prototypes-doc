3. { path: "/home/user1/dir1/foo.txt", recursive: false } sent on `deleted`<br>
<br>
Example (failure): <br>
1. "/home/user1/dir1"@0 received on `path`<br>
2 true@0 received on `recursive`<br>

### Input ports

* __path__: ` string `

    Receives the path of the file or directory to delete.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    - "/home/user1/dir1"<br>
    - "/home/user1/dir1/foo.txt"<br>
    <br>
    (To keep the application portable use "/" as path separator.)<br>


* __recursive__: ` boolean `

    Receives boolean flag which, when set, performs a recursive delete of all files & folders under the specified path.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    false<br>
    <br>
    (Be VERY cautious with recursive delete as it may cause irreversible harm on the host running the application if applied to a wrong path!)<br>

### Output ports

* __bounced__: ` {"path" :string, "recursive" :boolean} `

    Sends synced parameters if operation has failed.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    - { path: "/home/user1/dir1", recursive: true }<br>
    - { path: "/home/user1/dir1/foo.txt", recursive: false }<br>


* __deleted__: ` {"path" :string, "recursive" :boolean} `

    Sends synced parameters if the operation has succeeded.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    - { path: "/home/user1/dir1", recursive: true }<br>
    - { path: "/home/user1/dir1/foo.txt", recursive: false }<br>


* __error__: ` {"error" :string} `

    Sends error information if the operation has failed.<br>
    <br>
    Example: <br>
    {<br>
      "error": "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'home/user1'"<br>
    }<br>
